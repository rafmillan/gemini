THE GOLD MEDAL. \
It was growing toward evening on a mild day of early spring in the year 1527. \
The sun, which had been hidden all day, peeped out of a rent in the curtain of gray cloud, \
and did his best to make beautiful the town of Bridgewater, by gilding the tops of the houses \
and the tall tower of the beautiful church of St. Mary, lighting up the boats and vessels in the \
river, and sending his rays on all sorts of frolicsome errands through the streets and alleys of the sober old town. \
In pursuance of these errands, a set of bright beams found out and entered the shop of John Lucas, \
the well-known master baker in Bridge Street, and finding therein abundance of well-scoured boards, \
bright earthenware and burnished pewter, did so disport themselves, that at last they attracted the \
attention of Master Lucas himself, who was knitting his brows over certain crabbed-looking accounts, \
apparently trying to extract some meaning from them, by the help of a huge pair of horn spectacles. \
The moment Master Lucas raised his head, the aforesaid frolicsome beams at once forsook, as it seemed, \
all their former playthings, to dance about his portly person, light up his gray hair, and make little \
mimic suns in his eyes and glasses. And certainly they might have gone a long way, and have seen nothing \
pleasanter than the old man's face. \
\"Heyday!\" he exclaimed. \"Here is the sun at last, to be sure, and a welcome sight after all the cloudy \
days we have had of late. Well, well! The sun always shines at last, that is one comfort. Eh, Mary Brent?\" \
he added, addressing himself to a pale and poorly clad woman who had just entered the shop. \
The poor woman shook her head sadly. \"I suppose it does, somewhere,\" said she, \"but little of it comes my way of late years.\""
